First of all, make sure that your device is running on the version of Android 6.0 or upper.

1. Download the zip
2. Extract the project file
3. Open Android Studio (last version)
4. Click on « Open an existing Android Studio project » -> Select the unzipped project file (yourPath/Projet_Android)

5. Once the build is done, run the app on your device. The application will start and the main page will appear

6. Now you have two choices:

	6.a. Visitor: the button is blocked and message is returned because the local database is not created yet (unblocked once the communication member has created one pseudo jury at least).

	6.b.Member ESEO: when you click on the button a login page is displayed

		You can be logged as:
			6.b.1: Member ESEO who is not a tutor of a project neither member of jury
			6.b.2: Member ESEO who is tutor of project(s) and member of a jury (or more)
			6.b.3: Member ESEO only member of a jury (or more)
